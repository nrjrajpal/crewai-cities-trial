The economy of Rome is a complex subject encompassing both its current status and its rich historical context. While precise, up-to-the-minute data on GDP and unemployment rates requires accessing real-time economic databases (beyond the scope of my current tools), the following information can be gleaned from available resources:

**Current Economic Situation:**

The available information indicates that Rome's economy in 2005 contributed 6.7% to Italy's national GDP, trailing only Milan (10%).[1]  More recent data would need to be sought from dedicated economic data sources.  The service sector is dominant, with tourism playing a major role.  Other key sectors include technology, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, and food industries.[1]  Industrial areas are located within Rome itself (such as the Tiburtina Valley) and in surrounding towns like Aprilia and Pomezia.[1]  Information on current unemployment rates and detailed GDP figures requires accessing updated economic statistics.

**Historical Context:**

Rome's economic history is extensive, spanning from its origins as an agrarian society to its development as the center of a vast empire.  The ancient Roman economy relied heavily on agriculture, supplemented by mining, metallurgy, and extensive trade networks that reached across the Mediterranean and beyond.[2]  The complexity of the Roman economy is reflected in the various financial institutions and practices that existed during that period.[10] The Roman Empire's economic power and organization allowed for vast infrastructure projects, military expansion, and the support of a large population.  However, later periods saw economic fluctuations and challenges, including the complexities of managing a massive empire and the effects of various political and social factors. [11]  A detailed study of this rich history necessitates examining specialized historical and economic sources.
