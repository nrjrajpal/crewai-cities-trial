Rome, Italy, is governed under a mayoral system as a "comune" (municipality) within the larger Italian parliamentary republic. [1, 3] The city's government consists of three main branches:

1.  **Mayor:** The Mayor of Rome is the head of the executive branch, directly elected by the city's residents. [3]  The current mayor (as of my last knowledge update) is Roberto Gualtieri. [6]

2.  **City Council (Assemblea Capitolina):** This is the city's legislative body, responsible for enacting laws and regulations for the city of Rome. [1, 7]  It is a popularly elected council. [3]

3.  **Communal Committee:** This serves as the executive body. [3]


Historically, Rome's political structure has evolved significantly, from a kingdom to a republic and ultimately to its current status within a modern nation-state.  The ancient Roman Republic (509 BCE – 27 BCE) had a complex system including the Senate, Consuls, and Assemblies. [2, 8]   The transition from republic to empire brought about substantial changes in governance structures, culminating in the centralized imperial authority of the Roman Empire. [4]  Today, Rome's governance reflects its modern position within the Italian Republic, where local government functions are balanced with national-level policies and authority.  The city’s administration also incorporates various other local departments and agencies responsible for specific aspects of city services and infrastructure. [5]

While information about the exact composition and current details of the Communal Committee may require further research beyond this response, the fundamental structure of Rome's current governance, including its mayoral and legislative bodies, is well established. The 19 *Municipi* (municipalities) also contribute to local governance by dividing Rome into administrative districts. [9]
