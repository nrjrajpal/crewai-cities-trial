Rome, the capital of Italy, boasts a rich history, vibrant culture, and significant demographic profile.  Its history stretches back to its legendary founding in 753 BC, traditionally attributed to Romulus.[1]  From a small settlement on the Tiber River, Rome grew into a powerful republic and then an empire, dominating the Mediterranean world for centuries.  The Roman Empire's legacy is evident in its monumental architecture, including the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Pantheon, which remain major tourist attractions today.[2]  The empire’s influence extended beyond its geographical boundaries, leaving an indelible mark on law, language, architecture, and political thought, shaping much of Western civilization.[3]  Its fall in the 5th century AD marked a pivotal point in European history, but Rome continued to be a significant center of power and culture throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance.[4]  The city's modern iteration retains a blend of ancient and modern elements, visible in its streets, buildings, and ongoing cultural activities.


Culturally, Rome is a melting pot. The city's rich history is interwoven with its contemporary arts scene, showcasing a remarkable diversity of expression.  Ancient Roman traditions continue to resonate, visible in its cuisine, religious practices, and social customs.[5]  The influence of the Catholic Church is profound, making the Vatican City, an independent city-state within Rome, a major center of Catholicism globally.[6]  Rome is also a hub for international tourism, attracting millions of visitors annually who come to experience its historical sites and vibrant cultural offerings.[7]   The city's artistic heritage ranges from ancient sculpture and mosaics to Renaissance masterpieces and modern installations, making it a globally significant center for art and culture.


Demographically, Rome is the most populous metropolitan city in Italy, with a population exceeding 4 million in its metropolitan area.[8]  A substantial percentage of the population is non-Italian, reflecting Rome's status as a major international city.  Significant immigrant communities from various European countries, as well as from other parts of the world, contribute to the city's rich multicultural fabric.[9]  The city's population density, combined with its historical significance, makes its management and preservation a significant ongoing challenge. [10] The demographics paint a picture of a dynamic and ever-evolving city, a blend of the ancient and the contemporary, constantly shaped by global migrations and cultural exchanges.
