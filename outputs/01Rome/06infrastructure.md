Rome's infrastructure is a complex tapestry woven from millennia of development, blending ancient marvels with modern necessities.  The city's transportation system [1], while extensive, faces challenges related to traffic congestion. Its extensive road network, a legacy of the Roman Empire's impressive road-building capabilities [2], forms the backbone of the city's transportation, supplemented by a developing metro system [3] and bus network.

The city's utilities are equally significant.  The ancient Romans were pioneers in water management, their aqueducts [4] providing a model for modern systems.  While Rome's current water infrastructure has evolved significantly, the challenge of managing water resources for a large metropolitan area remains.  Similarly, the history of sanitation [5] in Rome, from the impressive sewer systems of the ancient city [6] to the modern sewage treatment facilities, illustrates the continuous evolution of infrastructure.  Ongoing projects, such as the expansion of the metro system [7], aim to improve public transit and alleviate traffic congestion.

Furthermore, the Roman Forum [8], a testament to Roman engineering and city planning, showcases the historical context of the city's infrastructure.  The city's development, from the ancient reliance on aqueducts to the modern utilization of advanced technology, reflects both remarkable innovation and ongoing adaptation.  Specific details of current projects require further research and access to local sources.
