I was unable to definitively identify the top 5 companies in Tokyo using the provided tools.  While Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sony, and Toyota are confirmed to be headquartered in Tokyo, the remaining two companies in a top 5 ranking require further research using tools beyond my current capabilities.  To complete this task, access to a database of company headquarters or a reputable ranking of Tokyo-based companies by revenue, market capitalization, or other relevant metrics would be needed.
