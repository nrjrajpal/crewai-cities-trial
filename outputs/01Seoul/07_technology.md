**Major Tech Companies:**  Seoul is home to numerous prominent technology companies, including global giants like Samsung Electronics [1, 2, 3], a leading producer of electronics and semiconductors, and LG Corporation [1, 2, 3], a major player in electronics, chemicals, and telecommunications.  Other significant players include Naver, a dominant internet portal and search engine company in South Korea [4], and SK Group, a conglomerate with interests in telecommunications, semiconductors, and energy [5].  Many smaller technology companies and startups are also based in Seoul, contributing significantly to the city's vibrant tech ecosystem [6].  The city's supportive infrastructure and governmental initiatives make it attractive to both domestic and international tech businesses.


**Technological Innovations:** Seoul is at the forefront of several technological advancements.  The city is a hub for innovation in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI) [7], semiconductors [7, 8], and the metaverse [9], with significant government investment and initiatives aimed at promoting research and development in these areas [7, 10].  The South Korean government has launched various programs to support research, development, and commercialization in cutting-edge technologies [7].  Startups in Seoul are actively developing innovative technologies and applications, particularly in areas such as fintech [11] and mobile applications [11]. The city benefits from a strong pool of skilled talent, further enhancing its position as a center for technological progress.


**Government-Led Initiatives:** The South Korean government plays a crucial role in fostering technological growth in Seoul. Initiatives like the “Digital Strategy of Korea” [12] aim to promote digital transformation and strengthen the country’s competitiveness in the global technology market.  The government provides financial incentives, fosters collaborations between businesses and research institutions, and actively promotes the development of key technologies [13].  Furthermore,  government efforts to develop robust infrastructure, including reliable internet access and advanced telecommunications networks, underpin the city's technological prowess [14].
