Seoul's governmental structure operates within the framework of South Korea's presidential republic.  The city's administration is handled by the Seoul Metropolitan Government (SMG),[5] headed by an elected mayor responsible for the city's administration. [5]  The mayor is elected by the citizens of Seoul to a four-year term.[5]  The SMG also includes three vice mayors, with one overseeing political affairs and the other two managing administrative responsibilities.[5] The Seoul Metropolitan Council, with 112 members, acts as the city's legislative body.  [5] 101 members are elected through a first-past-the-post system, and 11 members are elected proportionally based on party lists. [5] The council's responsibilities include enacting and amending ordinances, reviewing and approving budgets, and overseeing the SMG's actions. [5]  While the SMG manages the city's affairs, the national government in South Korea retains significant influence and control over local government policies and budgets. [5] This reflects the overall centralized nature of the South Korean political system. [5]
