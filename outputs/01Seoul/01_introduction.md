Seoul, the capital of South Korea, boasts a rich history, vibrant culture, and diverse demographics.  Its history stretches back to 18 BC with the founding of Wiryeseong, the capital of the Baekje kingdom. [1, 2]  The city's significance grew significantly when it became the capital of the Joseon dynasty in 1394, undergoing rapid development and expansion under this rule. [3, 4]  Today, Seoul is a global metropolis, seamlessly blending modern skyscrapers with traditional architecture and cultural heritage sites.

Culturally, Seoul is a melting pot of ancient traditions and modern influences.  Confucianism has historically played a significant role in shaping social interactions and family structures. [5]  However, the cityâ€™s culture today is dynamic and multifaceted, showcasing a vibrant mix of traditional Korean arts, music, cuisine, and modern pop culture trends, reflected in its numerous museums, palaces, and bustling entertainment districts. [6]  This blend creates a unique cultural identity visible throughout the city.


Demographically, Seoul is the most populous city in South Korea, though its population has shown a slight decline in recent years, settling around 9.6 million residents in 2024.  [7, 8] The population is predominantly ethnically Korean, with a small but growing foreign resident population.  [9]  This demographic mix contributes to the city's globalized character, visible in its cosmopolitan atmosphere and international community.
