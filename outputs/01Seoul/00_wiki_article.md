# Seoul: A Global Metropolis

Seoul, the capital of South Korea, is a vibrant global metropolis seamlessly blending its rich history with modern advancements.  Its significance as a major economic and cultural center in East Asia is undeniable, stemming from its long history and strategic location.

## History

Seoul's history stretches back to 18 BC with the founding of Wiryeseong, the capital of the Baekje kingdom.<sup>[1, 2]</sup> Its importance grew exponentially when it became the capital of the Joseon dynasty in 1394, undergoing substantial development and expansion under their rule.<sup>[3, 4]</sup>  Today, the city stands as a testament to its enduring legacy, with numerous historical sites juxtaposed against its modern skyline.


## Culture

Seoul is a dynamic cultural hub, where ancient traditions and modern influences converge. Confucianism has historically played a major role in shaping societal norms and family structures.<sup>[5]</sup> However, contemporary Seoul boasts a diverse and vibrant culture, showcasing traditional Korean arts, music, cuisine, and modern pop culture trends.<sup>[6]</sup> This unique blend is evident in the city's many museums, palaces, and bustling entertainment districts.


## Demographics

Seoul is the most populous city in South Korea, although its population has recently shown a slight decline, settling around 9.6 million residents in 2024.<sup>[7, 8]</sup> The population is primarily Korean, with a growing foreign resident population contributing to its cosmopolitan atmosphere.<sup>[9]</sup>


## Geography

* **Location:** Seoul is situated in the northwest of South Korea, with coordinates approximately 37.566° N, 126.978° E.<sup>[10, 11]</sup>
* **Area:** The city covers 605.25 square kilometers (233.69 sq mi).<sup>[4, 10]</sup>
* **Population Density:** Seoul is remarkably dense, with estimates ranging from approximately 15,500 to 17,473 people per square kilometer.<sup>[12, 13, 14]</sup> This high density makes it one of the world's most densely populated major cities.
* **Ethnic Composition:** The population is predominantly Korean, with a relatively small but increasingly diverse foreign population.<sup>[9]</sup>


## Government

Seoul's governance operates within South Korea's presidential republic framework.  The Seoul Metropolitan Government (SMG), headed by an elected mayor, manages the city's administration.<sup>[5]</sup> The mayor serves a four-year term, and the SMG also comprises three vice mayors—one for political affairs and two for administrative responsibilities.<sup>[5]</sup> The Seoul Metropolitan Council, a 112-member legislative body (101 members elected via first-past-the-post and 11 proportionally through party lists),<sup>[5]</sup> enacts ordinances, reviews budgets, and oversees the SMG's actions.<sup>[5]</sup> However, the national government retains significant control over local policies and budgets, reflecting South Korea's centralized political system.<sup>[5]</sup>


## Economy

Seoul's economy is a vital part of South Korea's overall economic success. While precise figures for Seoul's GDP are challenging to isolate from national statistics, the city plays a dominant role. The service sector is the leading contributor, mirroring national trends.<sup>[1, 2, 3, 4]</sup>  Manufacturing remains significant, with substantial contributions from high-tech industries like electronics and information technology.<sup>[6, 7]</sup>  While South Korea boasts a low unemployment rate,<sup>[8, 9]</sup> precise employment figures for Seoul require access to more localized statistical databases, such as Statistics Korea (KOSTAT).


## Business Environment

Seoul's business environment presents both advantages and challenges. South Korea, and Seoul by extension, generally ranks favorably in ease of doing business compared to other nations.<sup>[1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]</sup> However, complexities remain:

* **Regulations:** The regulatory environment can be complex and at times opaque, creating difficulties for foreign companies.<sup>[1, 4]</sup>
* **Competition:**  South Korea's innovative industries foster a highly competitive market.
* **Cultural Factors:**  Understanding Korean business culture is crucial for success.<sup>[3]</sup>
* **Industry Standards:** Compliance with specific industry standards is essential.<sup>[1]</sup>

Precise data on Seoul's GDP and employment, separated from national data, necessitates accessing localized databases like Statistics Korea (KOSTAT).


## Infrastructure

Seoul possesses a remarkably developed infrastructure system.

**Transportation:** Seoul's integrated transportation network is highly efficient and accessible, including an extensive subway system, bus routes, taxi services, and a maglev train at Incheon International Airport.<sup>[7]</sup> Ongoing projects focus on expanding public transport options and enhancing road infrastructure.<sup>[2, 3, 4]</sup>  The city is also investing in pedestrian-friendly environments.<sup>[1]</sup>

**Utilities:** While detailed information on Seoul's utility infrastructure (water, electricity, gas) requires further research, surveys indicate a generally functional system.<sup>[7]</sup>

**Ongoing Projects:**  Large-scale infrastructure projects are underway, including highway expansion, new railway lines, and increased electric vehicle charging stations.<sup>[2, 3, 4, 9, 10]</sup>


## Technology Sector

Seoul's technology sector is a dynamic and evolving ecosystem.

**Major Companies:**  Global tech giants like Samsung Electronics and LG Corporation, along with domestic players such as Naver and SK Group, have a significant presence.  Numerous smaller companies and startups contribute to the city's vibrant tech scene.<sup>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</sup>

**Innovations:**  Seoul is at the forefront of AI, semiconductor, and metaverse technologies, driven by government support for R&D.<sup>[7, 8, 9, 10]</sup>

**Government Initiatives:** The South Korean government actively promotes technological growth through programs that encourage R&D, collaborations, and robust infrastructure development.<sup>[7, 12, 13, 14, 15]</sup>
