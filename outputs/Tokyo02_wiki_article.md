# Tokyo

**Tokyo** (東京, *Tōkyō*) is the capital of Japan and one of its 47 prefectures.  Located on the southeastern coast of Honshu island, it's the most populous metropolitan area in the world. [14]  Tokyo's history, geography, demographics, culture, and economy are complex and multifaceted, shaped by centuries of development and its position as a global center.

## History

The area now encompassing Tokyo has a long history.  Initially a small fishing village, it grew in importance during the Edo period (1603-1868) under the Tokugawa shogunate, becoming the nation's political and economic center. [15] Edo Castle, later renamed Tokyo Castle, became the seat of power. The city experienced significant population growth and urban expansion during this period. [16] Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Edo was renamed Tokyo and became the capital of the newly modernized empire of Japan. [17] The city underwent rapid modernization and industrialization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [18] It suffered immense devastation during World War II, largely rebuilt afterwards, and evolved into the modern metropolis seen today. [19]

Tokyo is situated on the Kantō Plain, bordered by mountains and the Pacific Ocean. Its geography is characterized by a mix of flatlands, hills, and coastal areas. [20]  The Tama River flows through western Tokyo, while several smaller rivers and canals crisscross the urban landscape. [21] The city is prone to earthquakes due to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. [22]  Tokyo’s geographical location has significantly influenced its development, facilitating trade and creating challenges related to natural disasters. [23]
