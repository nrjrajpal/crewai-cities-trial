This article provides an overview of Delhi's government, economy, business environment, infrastructure, and technology sector, drawing upon available research.  Due to limitations in readily available online information, some sections require further investigation for complete detail.


## Introduction

Delhi, a city of over 30 million people, serves as India's capital and is a significant center of political, economic, and cultural activity.  Its strategic location and historical importance have shaped its trajectory, transforming it into a modern megacity with a complex interplay of traditional and modern elements.  This article explores various facets of Delhi's development, highlighting its current state and potential for future growth.


## Data and Facts (Further research needed)
