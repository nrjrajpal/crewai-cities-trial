Pune, located in west-central Maharashtra, India, at the confluence of the Mula and Mutha rivers, is a city with a rich history and culture [1]. Its significance stems from its historical role as the seat of power for the Maratha Empire, profoundly shaping its cultural identity [1]. Early settlements date back to at least the 9th century CE, evidenced by copper plates from 858 and 868 CE, indicating agricultural activity and rule by the Rashtrakuta dynasty [2]. The city's prominence grew significantly under Maratha control, beginning in the early 17th century [3]. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, Pune served as the capital of the Bhonsle Marathas and later, under the Peshwas, became a major political center of the Maratha Empire [1, 4]. This era shaped the city's architecture, cultural traditions, and political landscape.

Currently, the primary governing body of Pune is the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) [11].  The PMC is responsible for the civic needs and infrastructure of the city [11].  Beyond the PMC, the District Collector and District Magistrate oversee revenue administration and coordinate functions within the Pune district [12].  The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) is also involved in planning the development of Pune and its surrounding areas [13].


Culturally, Pune embodies the Marathi ethos, emphasizing education, arts, crafts, and theatre [5]. It's renowned as the cultural capital of Maharashtra, associated with prominent figures like Tukaram and Jnaneshvara [5].

Demographically, Pune is a large metropolitan area. The 2011 Census reported a Pune metropolitan area population of 7.2 million [1]. More recent estimates vary; one source estimates the Pune city population at 4,569,000 in 2025 and the Pune metro population at 7,399,000 in 2025 [7]. Another source estimates the Pune metro area population to be 7,346,000 in 2024 and 7,166,000 in 2023 [8]. The Pune district's total area is 15,643 km2 (6,040 sq mi) [9]. The religious composition is predominantly Hindu, with a notable presence of other faiths [6]. The city's dynamic demographic profile reflects its diverse population. The city's area is approximately 331.26 sq km [10].
