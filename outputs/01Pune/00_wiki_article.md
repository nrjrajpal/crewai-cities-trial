# Pune

**Pune** (pronounced [puːnɛː]) is a major city in the Indian state of Maharashtra, located in the western-central part of the state at the confluence of the Mula and Mutha rivers.  Often referred to as the "Queen of the Deccan," Pune boasts a rich history and vibrant culture, significantly shaped by its role as the seat of power for the Maratha Empire.[1]

## History

Early settlements in the Pune area can be traced back to at least the 9th century CE.  Copper plates dating from 858 and 868 CE provide evidence of agricultural activity and rule under the Rashtrakuta dynasty.[2] The city's prominence grew considerably under Maratha control, starting in the early 17th century when Maloji Bhosale received a fiefdom in Pune from the Nizam Shahi of Ahmednagar.[3]  Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, Pune served as the capital of the Bhonsle Marathas and, later under the Peshwas, became a major political and cultural center of the Maratha Empire.[1, 4] This period significantly impacted Pune's architecture, traditions, and political landscape.

## Culture

Pune embodies the Marathi ethos, characterized by a strong emphasis on education, arts, crafts, and theatre.[5]  It is widely recognized as the cultural capital of Maharashtra and is closely associated with prominent figures like the poet-saints Tukaram (Dehu) and Jnaneshvara (Alandi), author of the *Jnaneshwari*, a commentary on the *Bhagavad Gita*.[5]  This blend of historical significance and rich cultural heritage forms a cornerstone of Pune's identity.

## Governance

The primary governing body of Pune is the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), responsible for the city's civic administration and infrastructure.[11]  The District Collector and District Magistrate oversee revenue administration and coordinate functions within the Pune district.[12]  The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) plans the development of Pune and its surrounding areas.[13]

## Economy

Pune's economy is a significant contributor to the state of Maharashtra. While precise GDP figures for the city alone are difficult to obtain from readily available sources, estimates suggest a substantial contribution. One source estimates the GDP at $69 billion.[1]  Key industries driving Pune's economic strength include manufacturing (employing over 500,000 people in 2014–15)[1], the automobile sector (with major players like Tata and Bajaj)[7], and a thriving IT sector.[2] Professional and business services also constitute a major part of the economy, employing a considerable portion of the 2.1 million-strong workforce.[14]  The city's real estate sector and educational institutions also contribute substantially to its overall economic activity.[2]  The ease of doing business in Pune, however, requires further detailed analysis; while land acquisition and regulatory complexities are potential challenges, the specific impact needs more in-depth research.  Relevant documentation like the PMC's Development Control Regulations (DCRs) offers a starting point for further investigation.[15, 16]

## Demography

Pune is a large metropolitan area. The 2011 Census reported a Pune metropolitan area population of 7.2 million.[1] More recent estimates vary significantly. One source estimates the Pune city population at 4,569,000 and the Pune metro population at 7,399,000 in 2025.[7]  Another source provides estimates of 7,346,000 for the Pune metro area in 2024 and 7,166,000 in 2023.[8] The Pune district's total area is 15,643 km² (6,040 sq mi).[9] The city's area is approximately 331.26 sq km.[10] The religious composition is predominantly Hindu, with a notable presence of other faiths.[6]

## Infrastructure

Pune's infrastructure is undergoing significant development.  Transportation includes buses and local trains,[1, 9] with ongoing upgrades like a metro rail system to improve connectivity.[2, 7, 10] The 170-km Pune Ring Road project (four phases) aims to reduce traffic congestion and improve access to surrounding areas.[8, 10]  Smart City Mission initiatives focus on modernizing utilities such as water supply, sewage, and waste management.[4, 9, 10]  The PMC plays a vital role in these infrastructural projects.[11] The development of Purandar Airport is expected to further enhance connectivity.[7]  However, challenges like land acquisition and regulatory complexities remain.[14]

## Technology Sector

Pune's technology sector is thriving, with a substantial presence of major IT companies and a growing number of startups. The city is a significant IT hub in India, [1, 2, 3, 4] benefiting from its educated workforce and the presence of companies like Persistent, Dell EMC, PWC, EY, Infosys, TCS, and Tech Mahindra. [3, 17, 18]  Hinjewadi is a major IT hub within Pune.[19]  The Smart City Mission further boosts the technological landscape.[5, 6]  The Pune Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (PSCDCL) is key in overseeing these smart city projects.[20]
