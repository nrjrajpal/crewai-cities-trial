Pune, located in west-central Maharashtra, India, at the confluence of the Mula and Mutha rivers, is a city rich in history and culture, often referred to as the "Queen of the Deccan".[1]  Its significance stems from its historical role as the seat of power for the Maratha Empire, a period which profoundly shaped its cultural identity.

Early settlements in the area date back to at least the 9th century CE, as evidenced by copper plates from 858 and 868 CE, indicating agricultural activity and rule by the Rashtrakuta dynasty.[2]  The city's prominence grew significantly under Maratha control, beginning in the early 17th century when Maloji Bhosale received a fiefdom in Pune from the Nizam Shahi of Ahmednagar.[3]  Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, Pune served as the capital of the Bhonsle Marathas and later, under the Peshwas, became a major political center of the Maratha Empire.[1, 4]  This era left an indelible mark, shaping the city's architecture, cultural traditions, and political landscape.

Culturally, Pune embodies the Marathi ethos, emphasizing education, arts, crafts, and theatre.[5] It's renowned as the cultural capital of Maharashtra, and is associated with prominent figures like the poet-saints Tukaram (Dehu) and Jnaneshvara (Alandi), author of the Jnaneshwari commentary on the Bhagavad Gita.[5] This blend of historical significance and rich cultural heritage contributes significantly to Pune's identity.

Demographically, Pune is a large metropolitan area with a significant population.  While precise population figures require consulting up-to-date census data, its size makes it a major city in Maharashtra and India. The religious composition is predominantly Hindu, with a notable presence of other faiths like Islam, Christianity, Jainism, Sikhism, and Buddhism.[6]  The city's dynamic demographic profile reflects its diverse and evolving population.  Further detailed demographic data should be sourced from contemporary census records.
