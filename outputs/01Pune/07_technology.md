The technology sector in Pune is thriving, with a significant presence of major IT companies and a growing number of startups.  Pune is recognized as a major IT hub in India [1, 2, 3, 4].  The city's success can be attributed to various factors, including its educated workforce and the presence of major companies like Persistent, Dell EMC, PWC, EY, Infosys, TCS, and Tech Mahindra [3, 17, 18].  Hinjewadi is particularly known as a large IT hub within the city [19].  Further, the city is actively developing its technological landscape through several government-led initiatives, prominently featuring the Smart City Mission. [5, 6]

**Government Initiatives and Smart City Projects:**

Pune's Smart City Mission encompasses numerous projects focused on enhancing various aspects of city life [5, 6].  These include improvements to transportation, such as the Pune Metro and the Pune Ring Road, designed to improve connectivity and alleviate traffic congestion [7, 8, 9, 10].  Efforts also extend to modernizing utilities infrastructure, focusing on water supply, sewage systems, and waste management [11, 12].  The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) plays a crucial role in the planning and implementation of these projects [11, 13].  The PMC's website provides detailed information on various smart city projects [13]. Initiatives also include improving "smart roads" and integrating technology into the public transportation system for optimized mobility [14].  The Pune Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (PSCDCL) is a key entity in overseeing these projects [20].

**Challenges:**

While significant progress is being made, challenges such as land acquisition and regulatory complexities remain in infrastructure development projects [15].
