Jodhpur's political and governmental structure is a multi-tiered system. At the local level, the city's governance is primarily handled by the Jodhpur Municipal Corporation.  However, recent administrative changes have divided the corporation into at least two entities: Jodhpur Nagar Nigam (North) and Jodhpur Nagar Nigam (South) [2, 3].  These corporations are responsible for managing the city's services and infrastructure.  The exact responsibilities and jurisdictions of each entity would require further research into local government documents.

The Jodhpur Municipal Corporation(s) operate under the oversight of the Rajasthan state government's Department of Local Self-Government [1]. This department is responsible for monitoring and coordinating the activities of all municipalities in the state, including Jodhpur [1, 8]. The relationship between the state government and the municipal corporations involves a degree of autonomy for the corporations in managing local affairs, but ultimate authority rests with the state government.  The recent bifurcation of the Jodhpur Municipal Corporation into North and South entities reflects a larger trend of administrative restructuring in Rajasthan [5], the specific reasons for which would require more in-depth investigation.
