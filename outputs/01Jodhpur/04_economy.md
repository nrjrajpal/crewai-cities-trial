Jodhpur's economy is multifaceted, lacking a single, easily accessible, and consistently reported GDP figure.  Different sources offer varying estimates. The Jodhpur Initiative estimates the GDP at approximately US$4 billion, broken down into sectors including handicrafts (US$350 million), tourism (US$240 million), and textiles (US$100 million)  [2].  Another source cites the 2020-21 District Domestic Product (DDP) at Rs. 49,42,069 lakhs (approximately US$6.0 billion at the time) at current prices, and Rs. 31,87,373 lakhs at constant 2011-12 prices [3]. These discrepancies highlight the challenge in obtaining precise GDP figures for Jodhpur specifically.  The city's economy is heavily influenced by several key industries.  These include:

*   **Handicrafts:** Jodhpur is renowned for its handicrafts, contributing significantly to its economic output [2].
*   **Tourism:** The city's historical significance and architectural marvels attract tourists, generating revenue and employment [2].
*   **Textiles:**  Textile production forms another important sector of the Jodhpur economy [2, 9].
*   **Manufacturing:** A significant portion of Jodhpur's labor force is employed in manufacturing, comprising the largest economic sector [1].
*   **Agriculture:** While less dominant than manufacturing, agriculture also contributes to the overall economy, although specific data regarding its contribution to Jodhpur's GDP is limited in the readily available information.


Employment trends for Jodhpur are not readily available in the sources consulted.  More detailed research into government economic reports and statistical publications of Rajasthan would be required to provide a more precise analysis of employment figures.
