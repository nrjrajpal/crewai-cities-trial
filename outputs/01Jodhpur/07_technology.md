The technology sector in Jodhpur is developing, with a mix of established IT companies, educational institutions, and government initiatives.  Several IT companies operate in Jodhpur, offering services such as web development, software development, and digital marketing.  [1, 2, 6, 8] Some notable companies include Adiyogi Technosoft, Appinfosol, Square Bits Pvt. Ltd., and Fistreet Systems Pvt. Ltd. [2]. The Software Technology Park of India (STPI) Jodhpur supports the growth of the IT/ITES industry in the region. [3]  The Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur (IITJ) plays a significant role in research and development, particularly in areas such as computer science and information technology. [4, 7, 9].  The Center for Technology Foresight and Policy (CTFP) at IIT Jodhpur also contributes to technology policy discussions and innovation. [8]. The Rajasthan government has undertaken several initiatives to promote IT and digital technologies, including the establishment of a state-of-the-art data center in Jodhpur. [5].  These initiatives aim to improve governance, employment opportunities, and bridge the socio-economic divide through technology. [5]. The Rajiv Gandhi Fintech Digital Institute in Jodhpur represents another government effort to promote technological growth. [3].  Further research is needed to fully document the extent of innovation in the Jodhpur tech sector and the impact of government initiatives.
