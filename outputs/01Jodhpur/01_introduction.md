Jodhpur, also known as the "Blue City," is a vibrant metropolis in Rajasthan, India.  Its history, culture, and demographics contribute to its unique identity.

**History:** Founded in 1459 by Rao Jodha, a Rajput chief of the Rathore clan,[1, 2, 3] Jodhpur served as the capital of the Marwar kingdom.  Its strategic location and strong rulers led to its growth and influence.  The city experienced significant development under various rulers, culminating in its expansion during the British colonial period (1818-1949),[2] when it was the largest princely state in the Rajputana Agency.  Post-independence, Jodhpur joined the state of Rajasthan in 1949.[2]  The Mehrangarh Fort, a majestic structure overlooking the city, stands as a testament to its rich past.[1]

**Culture:**  Jodhpurâ€™s culture is deeply rooted in Rajputana traditions. Its architecture, particularly the striking blue-washed houses, reflects this heritage.[4]  Traditional crafts, including textiles like Bandhani and Leheriya tie-dye, are integral to the city's cultural identity.[4]  The city also boasts a rich culinary heritage with diverse and flavorful Marwari cuisine.  Local festivals and celebrations further enrich the cultural landscape.
