The business climate in Jodhpur is multifaceted and influenced by several key industries, including handicrafts, tourism, textiles, manufacturing, and agriculture. While precise GDP figures for Jodhpur are difficult to obtain, estimates vary significantly, highlighting the lack of easily accessible, consistently reported data [2, 3].  The Jodhpur Initiative estimates the GDP at approximately US$4 billion, while another source cites a 2020-21 District Domestic Product (DDP) of approximately US$6 billion [2, 3].

The available information points to a mixed picture regarding the ease of doing business and regulatory environment.  While Rajasthan, the state Jodhpur is located in, has undertaken reforms to improve its ease of doing business ranking [4, 5], specific data on Jodhpur's regulatory environment is limited. Search results concerning ease of doing business in Rajasthan generally highlight challenges such as obtaining land for commercial use and navigating administrative and regulatory bottlenecks [4].  Further research is needed to understand the specific regulatory hurdles faced by businesses in Jodhpur.

The dominance of certain sectors like manufacturing in Jodhpurâ€™s employment landscape [1], and the significant contributions of handicrafts and tourism to the city's economy [2], indicate specific areas for potential future analysis concerning sector-specific regulations and challenges. The lack of readily available comprehensive data on employment trends in Jodhpur necessitates further research into government economic reports and statistical publications specific to Rajasthan.  The overall picture requires more detailed analysis of sector-specific regulations and the challenges businesses face in Jodhpur to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the business climate.
