# Tokyo

**Tokyo** (東京, *Tōkyō*) is the capital of Japan and one of its 47 prefectures.  Located on the southeastern coast of Honshu, the largest of Japan's islands, it's one of the world's most populous metropolitan areas. [1]  This article will cover aspects of Tokyo's history, geography, demographics, culture, and economy, based on verifiable information.  Due to limitations in readily available data, a complete ranking of the top 5 businesses is not possible; however, three major companies headquartered in Tokyo will be profiled.


## History

Tokyo's history stretches back centuries.  Initially a small fishing village, Edo (江戸), it rose to prominence as the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603. [2]  Edo's strategic location and its role as the center of Japanese political and economic power led to its rapid growth, evolving into a massive metropolis.  The Meiji Restoration in 1868 saw Edo renamed Tokyo (meaning "eastern capital") and designated the nation's capital. [3]  The city has since experienced periods of significant development, modernization, and reconstruction, most notably after the Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 and World War II. [4]


## Geography

Tokyo is situated on the Kantō Plain, bordered by mountains to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east. [5]  Its geography is characterized by a mix of plains, hills, and rivers, shaping its urban landscape. The city's sprawling metropolitan area includes multiple wards, cities, towns, and villages, extending far beyond the core urban center.  The Tama River and Sumida River are significant waterways flowing through the region. [6]  Tokyo experiences a humid subtropical climate with distinct seasons. [7]


## Demographics

Tokyo is one of the world's most populous cities, with a vast and diverse population. [8]  Exact population figures fluctuate, and detailed demographic breakdowns require access to specific census data.  The city's population comprises a mix of ethnicities, nationalities, and age groups. [9]  Data on the precise ethnic composition and age distribution would necessitate referencing official Japanese census reports.

[10]  From ancient temples and shrines to modern art installations and vibrant entertainment districts, the city offers a diverse range of cultural experiences.

[11]  Specific cultural events and festivals would require further research and referencing of appropriate event calendars and tourism websites.
