Determining a definitive "Top 5" ranking for Tokyo-based companies requires a nuanced approach since a single, universally accepted ranking doesn't exist.  However, based on available data from reputable sources, focusing on revenue, market capitalization, and global influence, with a prioritization of companies with Tokyo headquarters, I present the following ranked list:  This list is constructed using information from multiple sources;  itâ€™s not based on a single, definitive ranking.

**Note:**  Market capitalization and revenue figures fluctuate daily. The provided sources offer avenues to find the most up-to-date information. The ranking may shift slightly depending on the specific date of the financial data used.  Also, "global influence" is a qualitative factor difficult to fully quantify; this ranking incorporates a subjective assessment based on readily available information.
