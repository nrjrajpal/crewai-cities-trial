# Dubai

## Introduction

Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates (UAE), is a global city known for its extravagant architecture, luxurious lifestyle, and rapid economic development.  Situated on the southeastern coast of the Persian Gulf, Dubai has transformed itself from a small fishing village to a major international hub for business, tourism, and trade in a remarkably short period. This article provides an overview of Dubai's history, geography, demographics, culture, and its leading businesses.

## History

Dubai's history is deeply intertwined with pearling and fishing. For centuries, its economy relied heavily on these activities. [1] The Al Maktoum family established their rule in the 19th century, laying the groundwork for the emirate's future development. [2] The discovery of oil in the 1960s marked a turning point, providing the financial resources to fuel ambitious modernization projects. [3]  However, Dubai's leaders foresaw the limitations of oil dependency and embarked on a diversification strategy focused on tourism, trade, and real estate, leading to the city's remarkable transformation. [4] This strategy, combined with forward-thinking infrastructure investments, established Dubai as a global player. [5]

## Geography

Dubai is located on the southeastern coast of the Persian Gulf. [6]  Its geography is characterized by a largely flat desert landscape with limited natural freshwater resources. [7] The coastline, however, is significant, offering access to the sea and enabling the development of its crucial port and substantial maritime industry. [8] The city's desert environment also plays a crucial role in shaping its architectural styles and overall urban design. [9]

## Demographics

Dubai has a remarkably diverse population.  While Emirati citizens constitute a minority, a large proportion of the population comprises expatriates from various countries across the globe. [10] This multicultural composition significantly influences the city's culture, cuisine, and overall societal fabric. [11] The rapid population growth reflects the city's status as a major economic and employment center. [12] Accurate population figures fluctuate frequently, demanding regular updates. [13]


## Culture

Dubai's culture is a dynamic blend of traditional Emirati heritage and modern cosmopolitan influences.  While Islamic traditions remain central to the city's identity, [14] the influx of expatriates has brought diverse cultures and customs.  The city balances its traditional heritage with a modern, forward-looking approach, evident in its architecture, arts, and social norms. [15]  This creates a unique cultural landscape constantly evolving. [16] Traditional aspects such as falconry and souks (markets) coexist with modern art galleries and international events. [17]


## Top Businesses/Companies

[22] Its operations include passenger and cargo services, and its subsidiary, dnata, provides ground handling services.  The airline's success reflects exceptional strategic planning and operational efficiency. [23]
