**Dubai** is one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  A global city and a major hub for international trade and tourism, it's known for its luxurious lifestyle, impressive architecture, and rapid economic growth.  This article explores various aspects of Dubai, including its history, geography, demographics, culture, and prominent businesses.

## History

Dubai's history is deeply intertwined with pearl diving and fishing.<sup>[1]</sup>  For centuries, it was a small fishing village, with its economy heavily reliant on maritime trade.<sup>[1]</sup> The discovery of oil in the 1960s dramatically transformed Dubai's trajectory.<sup>[2]</sup>  Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the ruler at the time, spearheaded the city's ambitious modernization and diversification plan, focusing on infrastructure development, tourism, and trade.<sup>[2]</sup>  The construction of the Port Rashid (1972) and Jebel Ali Port (1979) further solidified Dubai's position as a key trading hub.<sup>[3]</sup> This period marked the beginning of Dubai's meteoric rise to global prominence.<sup>[4]</sup>

## Geography

Dubai is located on the southeastern coast of the Persian Gulf.<sup>[5]</sup> The landscape is predominantly desert, with vast stretches of sand dunes.<sup>[5]</sup> However, the city's coastline offers access to the sea, influencing its development as a major port and tourist destination.<sup>[6]</sup> The city's geography also includes artificial archipelagos, such as the Palm Jumeirah and The World Islands, built to extend the coastline and enhance tourism potential.<sup>[7]</sup>


## Demographics

Dubai's population is highly diverse, reflecting its international appeal.<sup>[8]</sup> While Emirati nationals make up a minority of the population, a significant majority consists of expatriates from various countries, drawn by economic opportunities.<sup>[8]</sup> This mix of cultures contributes to the city's cosmopolitan atmosphere.<sup>[9]</sup>  The city’s rapid population growth is a direct result of its economic success and attractiveness as a global hub.<sup>[10]</sup>


## Culture

Dubai's culture is a unique blend of traditional Emirati heritage and contemporary influences.<sup>[11]</sup>  While maintaining respect for its Islamic roots,<sup>[11]</sup> the city embraces modern trends and offers a vibrant multicultural experience.<sup>[12]</sup> Traditional aspects, such as falconry, are still practiced, showcasing the city's past, whilst the futuristic architecture and globally recognized events like Dubai Shopping Festival and Dubai Expo showcase its modern dynamism.<sup>[13, 14]</sup>  The city's commitment to luxury and its focus on high-end tourism are integral aspects of its culture.<sup>[15]</sup>
